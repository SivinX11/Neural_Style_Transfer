## Introduction
This is a Tensorflow walkthrough of Neural Style Transfer, a widely used application of Convolutional Neural Networks. This Deep Learning technique helps you generate an output image(denoted as G) based on the content image (denoted as C) but drawn or painted in the style of another image(called the style image, denoted as S). This technique majorly depends on the way the initial and the deeper layers of ConvNets extract the features from the given style image and implement it on the content image.
